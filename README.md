# Crypto-Currency-Price-Prediction
The CSV data containing cryptocurrency metrics (Open, High, Low, Close prices) is read and cleaned and specific cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum & Bitcoin cash) are filtered out and visualized using line plots, boxplots, and histograms. Further techniques like seasonal decomposition and moving averages are applied to understand trends and volatility. The isolation forest method is used for outlier detection which is highlighted using scatter and time series plot. Stationary test (ADF test) is performed and transformations are applied. SARIMAX modelling is used to predict future price trends and LSTM neural network is built for forecasting, leveraging scaled data and sequential inputs. Predictions are plotted alongside historical and test data for visual comparison.
